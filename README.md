# MNITS_DigitRecognition
The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model capable of recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset is a large collection of handwritten digits, commonly used as a benchmark in the field of machine learning and computer vision.

# MNIST Digit Recognition Using Deep Learning

## Overview

This project implements a digit recognition system using deep learning techniques on the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify these digits based on their pixel values.

## Project Structure

- **`data/`**: Contains the MNIST dataset files.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- **`src/`**: Source code for data preprocessing, model architecture, training, and evaluation.
- **`requirements.txt`**: List of dependencies required to run the code.
- **`README.md`**: This file.
