# MNITS_DigitRecognition
The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model capable of recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset is a large collection of handwritten digits, commonly used as a benchmark in the field of machine learning and computer vision.
